# Mushroom Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a machine learning project for mushroom classification. The dataset, titled "Mushroom Classification", was sourced from Kaggle and includes over 8,000 samples. These samples represent 23 species of gilled mushrooms from the Agaricus and Lepiota families, originally documented in The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each data point includes 23 features that describe various physical characteristics of the mushrooms.
